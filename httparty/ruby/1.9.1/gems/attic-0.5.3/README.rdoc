= Attic - v0.5

A place to hide private instance variables in your Ruby objects.

== Example

    require 'attic'
    
    class String
      extend Attic
      attic :timestamp
    end
    
    a = "anything"
    a.timestamp = "1980-11-18"
    a.instance_variables                      # => []
    a.timestamp                               # 1980-11-18
                                              
    a.attic_variables                         # => [:timestamp]
    
    a.attic_variable_set :tags, [:a, :b, :c]
    a.attic_variable_get :tags                # [:a, :b, :c]
    
    a.attic_variables                         # => [:timestamp, :tags]
 
== Some objects have no metaclasses

Symbol and Fixnum objects do not have metaclasses so instance variables are hidden in the object itself.
